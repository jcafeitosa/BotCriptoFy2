# CEO Module Improvements â€” 2025-10-18

Enhancements to the CEO dashboard module focused on removing placeholders, improving security, adding advanced endpoints, and deriving metrics from real data sources.

Highlights
- Derived financial metrics from P&L and Cash Flow reports (no placeholders)
- Derived system metrics from Prometheus registry (avg response time, error rate, API calls)
- Storage usage computed from local storage path with safe fallback
- Active resource counts via DB (bots running, active strategies, gateways with webhooks)
- Alert lifecycle endpoints (acknowledge, resolve, dismiss)
- Executive summary endpoint combining KPIs, critical alerts, and critical audit events
- User trends endpoint (daily new users)
- Unit tests for metrics summarization

Key Changes
- Services
  - `getFinancialHealthMetrics`: uses ReportService (P&L/Cash Flow) + invoices/payments to compute net margin, cash balance, burn, runway, receivables/payables
  - `getSystemHealthMetrics`: computes from metrics JSON and filesystem; adds counts for bots/strategies/webhooks
  - New alert actions: `acknowledgeAlert`, `resolveAlert`, `dismissAlert`
  - New trends: `getUserTrends`
- Routes
  - GET `/api/v1/ceo/executive-summary`
  - PATCH `/api/v1/ceo/alerts/:id/ack|resolve|dismiss`
  - GET `/api/v1/ceo/trends/users`
- Utilities
  - `summarizeHttpMetrics` with unit tests

Security & RBAC
- All routes gated by `sessionGuard` and role requirement `['ceo','admin','super_admin']`
- Input params validated via Elysia schemas

Testing
- Unit tests: `backend/src/modules/ceo/utils/__tests__/metrics.util.test.ts`

Notes
- Gross margin depends on COGS classification in the chart of accounts. Until available, net margin is used as a conservative proxy.
- Storage usage uses `STORAGE_LOCAL_PATH` (default `./storage/documents`) and optionally `STORAGE_LIMIT_GB` for limit.
