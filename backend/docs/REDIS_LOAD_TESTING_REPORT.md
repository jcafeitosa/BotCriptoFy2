## Known Limitations

### Current Limitations

#### 1. Burst Traffic

**Issue**: System optimized for sustained load, not burst traffic
**Impact**: Latency spikes up to 20-30ms during sudden bursts
**Mitigation**: Implement rate limiting and buffering
**Status**: Acceptable for production (burst latency still <50ms)

#### 2. Event Ordering

**Issue**: Cross-channel event ordering not guaranteed
**Impact**: Minimal - events have timestamps
**Mitigation**: Bot logic uses timestamps for ordering
**Status**: Design decision, not a limitation

#### 3. Message Persistence

**Issue**: Redis pub/sub is fire-and-forget
**Impact**: Offline instances miss events
**Mitigation**: Acceptable for real-time market data (always fresh)
**Future**: Consider Redis Streams for critical events

#### 4. Single Redis Instance

**Issue**: Redis is single point of failure
**Impact**: Service interruption if Redis fails
**Mitigation**: Deploy Redis Sentinel or Cluster
**Status**: Standard practice for production

### Performance Limits

**Tested Limits**:
- ✅ 1000 events/second sustained
- ✅ 5 concurrent instances
- ✅ 240,000 deliveries per minute
- ✅ Sub-2ms latency under load

**Projected Limits** (untested):
- 5000 events/second (50 instances)
- 1,000,000 deliveries per minute
- Sub-10ms latency

**Hard Limits**:
- Redis pub/sub: ~100,000 events/second (theoretical)
- Network bandwidth: Typically not a bottleneck
- Application instances: Limited by infrastructure

---

## Optimization Opportunities

### Immediate Optimizations (Already Implemented)

✅ **Event batching**: Publishing 10 events per interval
✅ **Self-filtering**: Preventing echo with instance IDs
✅ **Connection pooling**: Reusing Redis connections
✅ **Efficient serialization**: JSON.stringify with minimal overhead

### Future Optimizations

#### 1. Message Compression

**Potential**: Reduce network usage by 60-80%
**Trade-off**: +0.5-1ms latency for compression/decompression
**Recommendation**: Implement for wide-area deployments

#### 2. Binary Protocol

**Potential**: Reduce message size by 40-60%
**Trade-off**: +0.2-0.5ms latency, increased complexity
**Recommendation**: Consider for extreme scale (10,000+ events/s)

#### 3. Connection Multiplexing

**Potential**: Reduce Redis connection overhead
**Trade-off**: Slightly increased complexity
**Recommendation**: Beneficial for 20+ instances

#### 4. Adaptive Rate Limiting

**Potential**: Prevent system overload during burst traffic
**Trade-off**: May delay some events
**Recommendation**: Implement for production safety

#### 5. Geo-Distributed Redis

**Potential**: Lower latency for globally distributed instances
**Trade-off**: Increased infrastructure complexity
**Recommendation**: Enterprise deployments only
