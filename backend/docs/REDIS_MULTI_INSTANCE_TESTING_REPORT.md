## Testing Infrastructure

### Test Utility

**File**: `src/scripts/test-redis-multi-instance.ts` (450 lines)

**Features**:
- Simulates multiple application instances in a single process
- Unique instance IDs for accurate self-filtering
- Real-time metrics collection per instance
- Latency measurement and statistical analysis
- Comprehensive result reporting

**Usage**:
```bash
# Default test (3 instances, 20 seconds)
bun src/scripts/test-redis-multi-instance.ts

# Custom configuration
bun src/scripts/test-redis-multi-instance.ts --instances=5 --duration=30

# Verbose output (shows every event transmission)
bun src/scripts/test-redis-multi-instance.ts --verbose
```

### Architecture Enhancement

**Instance ID Support**

Added `instanceId` configuration parameter to RedisEventBridge to enable:
- Unique identification of each instance (even in same process for testing)
- Accurate self-filtering to prevent echo effects
- Production use with `process.pid` (default)
- Testing with custom IDs (`test-instance-0`, `test-instance-1`, etc.)

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// Configuration interface
export interface RedisEventBridgeConfig {
  // ... existing fields
  instanceId?: string | number; // Defaults to process.pid
}

// Publishing
const message = JSON.stringify({
  type: event.type,
  data: event.data,
  timestamp: Date.now(),
  source: this.config.instanceId, // Instance identifier
});

// Filtering
if (source === this.config.instanceId) {
  return; // Ignore own messages
}
```

## Test Scenario 1: Standard (3 Instances)

### Configuration

- **Instances**: 3
- **Duration**: 20 seconds
- **Publish Rate**: ~10 events/second
- **Event Types**: Ticker, Trade (random distribution)

### Performance Scaling

| Metric          | 3 Instances | 5 Instances | Difference |

*Single outlier event, not indicative of normal performance

### Event Distribution

| Instances | Published | Total Delivered | Per-Instance Receives | Ratio |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|----------------------|-------|
| 3         | 195       | 390             | ~130 each            | 2:1   |
| 5         | 294       | 1,176           | ~235 each            | 4:1   |

**Pattern**: Each instance receives (n-1) × total events, where n = number of instances

---

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

#### 1. `redis-event-bridge.ts`

**Enhancement**: Added `instanceId` configuration parameter

**Changes**:
```typescript
// Added to config interface (line 35)
instanceId?: string | number;

// Default configuration (line 55)
instanceId: process.pid, // Default to process PID

// Publishing method (line 225)
source: this.config.instanceId, // Instead of process.pid

// Message handling (line 407)
if (source === this.config.instanceId) { // Instead of process.pid
  return; // Ignore own messages
}
```

**Impact**:
- ✅ Enables testing with multiple instances in same process
- ✅ Production use still defaults to process.pid
- ✅ Backward compatible (no breaking changes)
- ✅ Proper self-filtering in all scenarios

### Files Created

#### 1. `test-redis-multi-instance.ts` (450 lines)

**Features**:
- Multiple instance simulation
- Per-instance metrics tracking
- Latency measurement and statistics
- Event distribution verification
- Comprehensive result reporting

**Test Methodology**:
1. Create n instances with unique IDs
2. Connect all instances to Redis
3. Subscribe all instances to all channels
4. Randomly select instance to publish events
5. Track which instance published which event
6. Measure latency from publish to receive
7. Verify no instance receives its own events
8. Calculate distribution accuracy

### Production Recommendations

#### 1. Deployment Strategy

**Single WebSocket Host + Multiple Bot Instances**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐

   50 bots              50 bots       50 bots
```

**Benefits**:
- Single set of WebSocket connections (cost-effective)
- Unlimited horizontal scaling of bot instances
- Fault isolation (WS failures don't affect bot processing)
- Geographic distribution possible

#### 2. Configuration

**WebSocket Host**:
```typescript
const wsManager = new MarketDataWebSocketManager({
  enableRedis: true,
  redis: {
    host: 'redis.production.internal',
    port: 6379,
    password: process.env.REDIS_PASSWORD,
    keyPrefix: 'ws:',
    instanceId: 'websocket-host', // Unique ID
    enablePublishing: true,
    enableSubscription: false, // Host doesn't need to receive
  },
});
```

**Bot Instances**:
```typescript
const wsManager = new MarketDataWebSocketManager({
  enableRedis: true,
  redis: {
    host: 'redis.production.internal',
    port: 6379,
    password: process.env.REDIS_PASSWORD,
    keyPrefix: 'ws:',
    instanceId: process.pid, // Each instance has unique PID
    enablePublishing: false, // Bots don't publish
    enableSubscription: true,
  },
  // No exchange connections needed on bot instances
});
```

#### 3. Monitoring

**Metrics to Track**:
- Delivery rate (should be >99%)
- Latency (P50, P95, P99)
- Self-received events (should be 0)
- Errors per instance
- Events published/received per instance
- Redis connection status

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Get metrics
const metrics = wsManager.getSystemMetrics();

// Monitor
console.log('Redis Metrics:', metrics.redis);
// {
//   connected: true,
//   publishedEvents: 15000,
//   receivedEvents: 45000,
//   errors: 0,
//   subscriptions: 8
// }
```

#### 4. Scaling Guidelines

**Horizontal Scaling**:
- **3-5 instances**: Optimal for most use cases
- **5-10 instances**: High-volume trading (1000+ bots)
- **10+ instances**: Enterprise scale, geographic distribution

**Capacity Planning**:
| Instances | Bots per Instance | Total Bots | Events/Sec | Redis CPU |
|-----------|-------------------|------------|------------|-----------|
| 1         | 100               | 100        | 100-500    | <5%       |
| 3         | 100               | 300        | 300-1,500  | <10%      |
| 5         | 100               | 500        | 500-2,500  | <15%      |
| 10        | 100               | 1,000      | 1K-5K      | <25%      |

**Redis Specifications**:
- Minimum: 512MB RAM, 1 CPU core
- Recommended: 2GB RAM, 2 CPU cores
- Enterprise: 8GB RAM, 4 CPU cores (10+ instances)

---

## Known Limitations

### 1. Event Ordering

**Issue**: Cross-channel event ordering not guaranteed
**Impact**: Minimal - events have timestamps
**Mitigation**: Bot logic handles out-of-order events using timestamps

### 2. No Message Persistence

**Issue**: Redis pub/sub is fire-and-forget (no durability)
**Impact**: If subscriber is down, it misses events
**Mitigation**: Acceptable for real-time market data (always fresh data)
**Future**: Consider Redis Streams for guaranteed delivery

### 3. Network Latency

**Issue**: Cross-region deployments may have higher latency
**Impact**: Latency could increase to 50-200ms for geographically distributed instances
**Mitigation**: Deploy Redis in same region as instances

### 4. Single Point of Failure

**Issue**: Redis server failure breaks event distribution
**Impact**: All instances become isolated
**Mitigation**:
- Redis Sentinel for automatic failover
- Redis Cluster for high availability
- Graceful degradation (local processing continues)

---

## Testing Methodology

### Test Approach

1. **Instance Simulation**
   - Create multiple RedisEventBridge instances in single process
   - Assign unique instance IDs
   - Connect all instances to same Redis server

2. **Event Generation**
   - Randomly select instance to publish events
   - Track which instance published each event
   - Use unique message identifiers (symbol + price + amount)

3. **Distribution Verification**
   - Verify each event is received by n-1 instances
   - Verify no instance receives its own events
   - Calculate delivery rate (received / expected)

4. **Latency Measurement**
   - Record timestamp when event is published
   - Calculate latency when event is received (now - published timestamp)
   - Aggregate statistics (avg, min, max, percentiles)

5. **Result Validation**
   - All instances connected: ✅
   - No self-received events: ✅
   - Delivery rate >95%: ✅
   - No errors: ✅
   - Avg latency <100ms: ✅
