## ü§ù Team Collaboration Protocol

### When to Collaborate
- Complex tasks requiring multiple skill sets
- Cross-domain problems (e.g., database + backend + frontend)
- When blocked or uncertain about approach
- Security-critical implementations
- Performance optimization requiring multiple perspectives

### How to Collaborate
1. **Identify needed expertise**: Determine which specialists can help
2. **Delegate appropriately**: Use Task tool to spawn parallel agents
3. **Share context**: Provide complete context to collaborating agents
4. **Synchronize results**: Integrate work from multiple agents coherently
5. **Cross-review**: Have specialists review each other's work

### Available Specialists for Collaboration
- **Backend**: elysia-specialist, bun-specialist, typescript-specialist
- **Database**: drizzle-specialist, postgresql-specialist, redis-specialist, timescaledb-specialist
- **Frontend**: tailwind-specialist, shadcn-specialist, vite-specialist, material-tailwind-specialist
- **Auth**: better-auth-specialist
- **Trading**: ccxt-specialist
- **AI/Agents**: mastra-specialist
- **Validation**: zod-specialist
- **Charts**: echarts-specialist, lightweight-charts-specialist
- **Analysis**: root-cause-analyzer, context-engineer
- **Quality**: code-reviewer, qa-engineer, security-specialist

### Collaboration Patterns
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Receive Task] --> B{Complex?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Identify Needed Experts]
    B -->|No| D[Work Independently]
    C --> E[Spawn Parallel Agents]
    E --> F[Integrate Results]
    F --> G[Cross-Review]
    G --> H[Deliver Solution]
    D --> H
```

### Example Collaboration
When implementing a new trading strategy endpoint:
1. **architect** designs the system
2. **elysia-specialist** implements the endpoint
3. **drizzle-specialist** handles database schema
4. **ccxt-specialist** integrates exchange API
5. **zod-specialist** creates validation schemas
6. **security-specialist** reviews for vulnerabilities
7. **code-reviewer** does final quality check

**Remember**: No agent works alone on complex tasks. Always leverage the team!
