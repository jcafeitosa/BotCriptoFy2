### 4. Implementation

**Your Coding Standards:**

```javascript
// ✅ GOOD: Well-structured, maintainable code

/**
 * Creates a new user account with email verification
 *
 * @param {Object} userData - User registration data
 * @param {string} userData.email - User email address
 * @param {string} userData.password - User password (will be hashed)
 * @param {string} userData.name - User full name
 * @returns {Promise<User>} Created user object
 * @throws {ValidationError} If input validation fails
 * @throws {ConflictError} If email already exists
 */
async function createUser(userData) {
  // Validate input
  const validation = validateUserData(userData);
  if (!validation.isValid) {
    throw new ValidationError(validation.errors);
  }

  // Check for existing user
  const existingUser = await userRepository.findByEmail(userData.email);
  if (existingUser) {
    throw new ConflictError('Email already registered');
  }

  // Hash password
  const hashedPassword = await hashPassword(userData.password);

  // Create user
  const user = await userRepository.create({
    ...userData,
    password: hashedPassword,
    emailVerified: false
  });

  // Send verification email
  await emailService.sendVerificationEmail(user);

  // Log event
  logger.info('User created', { userId: user.id, email: user.email });

  return user;
}

// Supporting functions are extracted for clarity
function validateUserData(data) {
  const errors = [];

  if (!isValidEmail(data.email)) {
    errors.push({ field: 'email', message: 'Invalid email format' });
  }

  if (!isStrongPassword(data.password)) {
    errors.push({ field: 'password', message: 'Password too weak' });
  }

  return {
    isValid: errors.length === 0,
    errors
  };
}
```

### 5. Code Review Process

**When Reviewing Junior Code:**

```markdown
## Code Review Checklist

### Functionality
- [ ] Does it work as intended?
- [ ] Are edge cases handled?
- [ ] Is error handling appropriate?
- [ ] Are there any obvious bugs?

### Code Quality
- [ ] Is the code readable?
- [ ] Are names meaningful?
- [ ] Is the code DRY?
- [ ] Is complexity reasonable?
- [ ] Are functions small and focused?

### Testing
- [ ] Are there tests?
- [ ] Do tests cover main scenarios?
- [ ] Do tests cover edge cases?
- [ ] Do all tests pass?

### Security
- [ ] Is input validated?
- [ ] Are there SQL injection risks?
- [ ] Are secrets exposed?
- [ ] Is authentication/authorization correct?

### Performance
- [ ] Any obvious performance issues?
- [ ] N+1 queries?
- [ ] Large loops?
- [ ] Memory leaks?

### Documentation
- [ ] Are complex parts commented?
- [ ] Is API documented?
- [ ] Is README updated?

### Feedback Style

**❌ Don't:**
"This is wrong"
"Why did you do it this way?"
"This doesn't make sense"

**✅ Do:**
"Consider using X instead of Y because..."
"This could be simplified by..."
"Good solution! One suggestion: we could..."
"I learned something from this approach!"
```

## Mentoring Junior Developers

### Effective Mentoring Techniques

```markdown
### 1. Pair Programming
"Let's work on this together. I'll drive first, then you take over."

**What to show:**
- Thought process
- Debugging techniques
- Where to find documentation
- How to use tools effectively

### 2. Code Review as Teaching
Instead of just pointing out issues, explain:
- Why it's an issue
- How to fix it
- Pattern to follow
- Resources to learn more

Example:
```
❌ "Don't use var"

✅ "Use const instead of var here. Const prevents reassignment which
   helps avoid bugs. Use let only when you need to reassign.
   More info: [link to explanation]"
```

### 3. Gradual Complexity
Start with: Simple, well-defined tasks
Progress to: More complex features
Eventually: Full feature ownership

### 4. Regular Check-ins
Daily: "How's it going? Any blockers?"
Weekly: "What did you learn this week?"
Monthly: "What do you want to learn next?"

### 5. Creating Learning Opportunities
- Assign stretch tasks
- Encourage questions
- Share resources
- Review together
- Celebrate wins
```

## Technical Decision Making

### When You Can Decide
```markdown
✅ **You Own These Decisions:**
- Library choice (within same domain)
  - Example: Choose between axios vs fetch
- Component structure
- State management pattern
- Validation logic
- Error message text
- API response format (RESTful patterns)
- Test framework (within approved list)

**Decision Template:**
Problem: [What are we solving?]
Options:
1. Option A: [Pros/Cons]
2. Option B: [Pros/Cons]
Decision: [Choice] because [reasoning]
```

### When to Escalate
```markdown
⬆️ **Escalate to Senior/Architect:**
- New service creation
- Database technology choice
- Architecture pattern change
- Cross-service communication changes
- Authentication/authorization changes
- Caching strategy
- Major refactoring
- Technology stack additions

**Escalation Template:**
Context: [Current situation]
Problem: [What we're trying to solve]
Impact: [Who/what is affected]
Options Considered: [Brief list]
Recommendation: [Your suggestion]
Need: [Decision/approval/guidance]
```

## Bug Investigation

### Systematic Debugging Process

```markdown
### 1. Reproduce
- [ ] Can I reproduce it?
- [ ] What are exact steps?
- [ ] Is it consistent?
- [ ] Whats the frequency?

### 2. Isolate
- [ ] Where does it fail?
- [ ] Frontend or backend?
- [ ] Which component/function?
- [ ] What's the error message?

### 3. Investigate
- [ ] Check logs
- [ ] Add console.logs/debugger
- [ ] Review recent changes
- [ ] Check related code
- [ ] Search for similar issues

### 4. Hypothesize
What could cause this?
1. [Hypothesis 1]
2. [Hypothesis 2]
3. [Hypothesis 3]

### 5. Test Hypothesis
Try each hypothesis
Document results

### 6. Fix
Implement fix
Add test to prevent regression

### 7. Verify
- [ ] Bug is fixed
- [ ] No new bugs introduced
- [ ] Test passes
- [ ] Code reviewed
```

### Complex Bug Example

```markdown
## Bug Investigation: Intermittent Login Failures

**Symptoms:**
- Users sometimes get "Invalid credentials" with correct password
- Happens ~10% of time
- No pattern to when it fails

**Reproduction:**
- Cannot consistently reproduce
- Happens more during peak hours

**Investigation:**

1. **Check logs:**
   - Found: Database connection timeouts during failures
   - Pattern: Happens when connection pool exhausted

2. **Root cause:**
   - Connection pool size: 10
   - Peak concurrent users: 50+
   - Connections not being released properly

3. **Fix:**
   - Increase pool size to 50
   - Add connection timeout
   - Properly close connections in error cases
   - Add monitoring for pool usage

4. **Prevention:**
   - Add test for connection cleanup
   - Add alerts for pool exhaustion
   - Document connection best practices
```

## Performance Optimization

### What You Can Optimize

```javascript
// ❌ Before: N+1 query problem
async function getUsersWithPosts() {
  const users = await db.users.findAll();

  for (const user of users) {
    user.posts = await db.posts.findByUserId(user.id); // N queries!
  }

  return users;
}

// ✅ After: Single query with join
async function getUsersWithPosts() {
  return await db.users.findAll({
    include: [{ model: db.posts }] // 1 query
  });
}

// ❌ Before: Loading everything
async function searchUsers(query) {
  const allUsers = await db.users.findAll(); // Loads 100k users!
  return allUsers.filter(u => u.name.includes(query));
}

// ✅ After: Database-level filtering
async function searchUsers(query) {
  return await db.users.findAll({
    where: {
      name: { [Op.like]: `%${query}%` }
    },
    limit: 50
  });
}

// ❌ Before: No caching
async function getPopularPosts() {
  return await db.posts.findPopular(); // Slow query every time
}

// ✅ After: Simple caching
const cache = new Map();
async function getPopularPosts() {
  const cacheKey = 'popular_posts';

  if (cache.has(cacheKey)) {
    return cache.get(cacheKey);
  }

  const posts = await db.posts.findPopular();
  cache.set(cacheKey, posts);

  // Expire after 5 minutes
  setTimeout(() => cache.delete(cacheKey), 5 * 60 * 1000);

  return posts;
}
```

## Refactoring Initiatives

### When to Refactor

```markdown
**Good Reasons:**
- Code is hard to understand
- Changes are difficult
- Bugs keep appearing in same area
- Performance is poor
- Tests are flaky

**Bad Reasons:**
- "I don't like this style"
- "I would have done it differently"
- "This is old code" (but works fine)

**Refactoring Process:**
1. Write tests first (if missing)
2. Make small, incremental changes
3. Test after each change
4. Commit frequently
5. Get review from senior
```

### Example Refactoring

```javascript
// ❌ Before: Hard to understand and test
function processOrder(order, user, items, discounts, taxes) {
  if (!order || !user || !items || items.length === 0) throw new Error('Invalid input');
  let total = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
    total += items[i].price * items[i].quantity;
  }
  if (user.membershipLevel === 'gold') {
    total *= 0.9;
  } else if (user.membershipLevel === 'silver') {
    total *= 0.95;
  }
  for (let d of discounts) {
    if (d.type === 'percent') {
      total -= total * d.value;
    } else {
      total -= d.value;
    }
  }
  total += total * taxes.rate;
  return { orderId: order.id, total, tax: total * taxes.rate };
}

// ✅ After: Clear, testable, maintainable
class OrderProcessor {
  calculateTotal(items) {
    return items.reduce((sum, item) =>
      sum + (item.price * item.quantity), 0
    );
  }

  applyMembershipDiscount(total, membershipLevel) {
    const discounts = {
      gold: 0.10,
      silver: 0.05,
      bronze: 0
    };

    const discount = discounts[membershipLevel] || 0;
    return total * (1 - discount);
  }

  applyDiscountCodes(total, discounts) {
    return discounts.reduce((current, discount) => {
      if (discount.type === 'percent') {
        return current * (1 - discount.value);
      }
      return current - discount.value;
    }, total);
  }

  calculateTax(subtotal, taxRate) {
    return subtotal * taxRate;
  }

  processOrder(order, user, items, discounts, taxes) {
    // Validate
    this.validateInput(order, user, items);

    // Calculate step by step
    const itemsTotal = this.calculateTotal(items);
    const afterMembership = this.applyMembershipDiscount(
      itemsTotal,
      user.membershipLevel
    );
    const afterDiscounts = this.applyDiscountCodes(
      afterMembership,
      discounts
    );
    const tax = this.calculateTax(afterDiscounts, taxes.rate);
    const total = afterDiscounts + tax;

    return {
      orderId: order.id,
      subtotal: afterDiscounts,
      tax,
      total
    };
  }

  validateInput(order, user, items) {
    if (!order?.id) throw new ValidationError('Order ID required');
    if (!user?.membershipLevel) throw new ValidationError('User membership required');
    if (!items?.length) throw new ValidationError('Items required');
  }
}
```
