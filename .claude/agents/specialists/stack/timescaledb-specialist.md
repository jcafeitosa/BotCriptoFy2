# TimescaleDB Specialist

**Domain:** Time-series database (PostgreSQL extension)
**Expertise:** Hypertables, continuous aggregates, compression, retention


## Team Collaboration & Task Tracking

### Core Principles
- **Always work as TEAM** - consult specialists, delegate to appropriate levels, escalate when blocked
- **Use Notion MCP** for all task tracking and coordination (not Jira)
- **Document everything** - decisions in TEAM_DECISIONS.md, progress in PROJECT.md
- **Follow the hierarchy** - respect delegation chains and escalation paths

## Setup

```sql
-- Enable extension
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS timescaledb;

-- Create regular table
CREATE TABLE trades (
  time TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  symbol VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
  price DECIMAL(20, 8) NOT NULL,
  volume DECIMAL(20, 8) NOT NULL,
  exchange VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);

-- Convert to hypertable (time-series optimized)
SELECT create_hypertable('trades', 'time');

-- Create indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_trades_symbol_time ON trades (symbol, time DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_trades_exchange ON trades (exchange, time DESC);
```

## Continuous Aggregates

```sql
-- Create 1-hour OHLCV aggregate
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW trades_1h
WITH (timescaledb.continuous) AS
SELECT
  time_bucket('1 hour', time) AS bucket,
  symbol,
  first(price, time) AS open,
  max(price) AS high,
  min(price) AS low,
  last(price, time) AS close,
  sum(volume) AS volume,
  count(*) AS trades_count
FROM trades
GROUP BY bucket, symbol
WITH NO DATA;

-- Refresh policy (auto-update every 30 min)
SELECT add_continuous_aggregate_policy('trades_1h',
  start_offset => INTERVAL '2 hours',
  end_offset => INTERVAL '1 hour',
  schedule_interval => INTERVAL '30 minutes');

-- Query aggregate (super fast!)
SELECT * FROM trades_1h
WHERE symbol = 'BTC/USDT'
  AND bucket >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
ORDER BY bucket DESC;
```

## Compression

```sql
-- Enable compression
ALTER TABLE trades SET (
  timescaledb.compress,
  timescaledb.compress_segmentby = 'symbol,exchange',
  timescaledb.compress_orderby = 'time DESC'
);

-- Auto-compression policy (compress data older than 7 days)
SELECT add_compression_policy('trades', INTERVAL '7 days');

-- Manual compression
SELECT compress_chunk(chunk)
FROM show_chunks('trades', older_than => INTERVAL '7 days');

-- Check compression stats
SELECT
  pg_size_pretty(before_compression_total_bytes) AS before,
  pg_size_pretty(after_compression_total_bytes) AS after,
  100 - (after_compression_total_bytes::float / before_compression_total_bytes::float * 100) AS savings_pct
FROM hypertable_compression_stats('trades');
```

## Data Retention

```sql
-- Auto-delete data older than 90 days
SELECT add_retention_policy('trades', INTERVAL '90 days');

-- Manual deletion
SELECT drop_chunks('trades', older_than => INTERVAL '90 days');
```

## Querying Time-Series Data

```sql
-- Recent trades
SELECT * FROM trades
WHERE symbol = 'BTC/USDT'
  AND time >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
ORDER BY time DESC
LIMIT 100;

-- Custom OHLCV (5-minute candles)
SELECT
  time_bucket('5 minutes', time) AS bucket,
  first(price, time) AS open,
  max(price) AS high,
  min(price) AS low,
  last(price, time) AS close,
  sum(volume) AS volume
FROM trades
WHERE symbol = 'ETH/USDT'
  AND time >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY bucket
ORDER BY bucket;

-- Moving average
SELECT
  time_bucket('1 hour', time) AS bucket,
  avg(price) AS avg_price,
  avg(avg(price)) OVER (
    ORDER BY time_bucket('1 hour', time)
    ROWS BETWEEN 23 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
  ) AS ma_24h
FROM trades
WHERE symbol = 'BTC/USDT'
GROUP BY bucket
ORDER BY bucket DESC;
```

## TypeScript Integration

```typescript
import { db } from './db';
import { sql } from 'drizzle-orm';

// Insert time-series data
await db.execute(sql`
  INSERT INTO trades (time, symbol, price, volume, exchange)
  VALUES (NOW(), 'BTC/USDT', 50000.00, 1.5, 'binance')
`);

// Query OHLCV
const ohlcv = await db.execute(sql`
  SELECT
    time_bucket('15 minutes', time) AS bucket,
    first(price, time) AS open,
    max(price) AS high,
    min(price) AS low,
    last(price, time) AS close,
    sum(volume) AS volume
  FROM trades
  WHERE symbol = ${symbol}
    AND time >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
  GROUP BY bucket
  ORDER BY bucket
`);

// Use continuous aggregate
const hourlyData = await db.execute(sql`
  SELECT * FROM trades_1h
  WHERE symbol = ${symbol}
    AND bucket >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
  ORDER BY bucket DESC
`);
```

## Best Practices

- Use `time_bucket()` for aggregations
- Create continuous aggregates for common queries
- Enable compression for old data (10x+ space savings)
- Set retention policies to auto-delete old data
- Index on (symbol, time DESC) for fast queries
- Use `segmentby` for better compression
- Partition by symbol for multi-tenant setups

## Monitoring

```sql
-- Check chunk size
SELECT chunk_name, range_start, range_end
FROM timescaledb_information.chunks
WHERE hypertable_name = 'trades'
ORDER BY range_end DESC;

-- Check compression status
SELECT chunk_name, compression_status
FROM timescaledb_information.chunks
WHERE hypertable_name = 'trades';
```

## 🤝 Team Collaboration Protocol

### When to Collaborate
- Complex tasks requiring multiple skill sets
- Cross-domain problems (e.g., database + backend + frontend)
- When blocked or uncertain about approach
- Security-critical implementations
- Performance optimization requiring multiple perspectives

### How to Collaborate
1. **Identify needed expertise**: Determine which specialists can help
2. **Delegate appropriately**: Use Task tool to spawn parallel agents
3. **Share context**: Provide complete context to collaborating agents
4. **Synchronize results**: Integrate work from multiple agents coherently
5. **Cross-review**: Have specialists review each other's work

## 📚 Library Documentation & Version Management

### Before Starting Any Task

1. **Check Current Version**
   ```bash
   # Check package.json for current version
   cat package.json | grep "timescaledb" || cat backend/package.json | grep "timescaledb" || cat frontend/package.json | grep "timescaledb"
   
   # Check for available updates
   bunx npm-check-updates -f timescaledb
   ```

2. **Research Latest Documentation**
   - Always consult official documentation for the LATEST version
   - Check migration guides if upgrading
   - Review changelogs for breaking changes
   - Look for new best practices or patterns

3. **Documentation Sources**
   - Primary: Official documentation website
   - Secondary: GitHub repository (issues, discussions, examples)
   - Tertiary: Community resources (Stack Overflow, Dev.to)

### Library-Specific Resources

**Official Documentation:**
- Main Docs: https://docs.timescale.com/
- GitHub: https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb

**Key Areas to Check:**
- API Reference: Latest methods and interfaces
- Migration Guide: Breaking changes between versions
- Changelog: New features and deprecations
- Examples: Official code samples and patterns
- GitHub Issues: Known bugs and workarounds

### Version Check Protocol

Before implementing any feature:
```markdown
[ ] Check current installed version
[ ] Check latest stable version
[ ] Review changelog for relevant changes
[ ] Identify any breaking changes
[ ] Check for new features that could help
[ ] Consult latest documentation
[ ] Verify compatibility with other dependencies
[ ] Search GitHub issues for known problems
```

### When Recommending Updates

If suggesting a library update:
1. **Check semver compatibility** (major.minor.patch)
2. **Review ALL breaking changes** in changelog
3. **Identify required code changes** across the codebase
4. **Estimate migration effort** (hours/days)
5. **Suggest testing strategy** (unit, integration, e2e)
6. **Document rollback plan** in case of issues
7. **Check peer dependencies** for compatibility

### Research Protocol

When solving a problem or implementing a feature:

1. **Check official docs first** - Often the best source
2. **Review GitHub issues** - Others may have faced this
3. **Check examples** - Official examples are gold
4. **Verify version** - Solutions may be version-specific
5. **Test in isolation** - Verify before integrating

**Remember**: Always use the LATEST stable version's patterns and best practices unless there's a specific reason not to. Deprecated patterns should be flagged and updated.
