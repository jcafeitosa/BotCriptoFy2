*Assumptions: 2-4 senior developers @ $100-200/hour*

### Go/No-Go Recommendation

**CONDITIONAL GO** with major caveats:

✅ **Proceed IF:**
- Funding secured for 10-month timeline
- Team of 2-4 senior developers committed
- Business case justifies $500K-$1M investment
- Willing to delay launch 10 months

🚫 **Do NOT proceed IF:**
- Need to launch within 3-6 months
- Limited funding (<$300K)
- Cannot secure experienced team
- Cannot tolerate security incidents

**Assumptions:**
- 10% conversion rate (free to paid)
- Average revenue per user (ARPU): $50/month
- 5% monthly churn
- 20% month-over-month growth

#### Break-Even Analysis

**Scenario A: Conservative**
- Investment: $800,000
- MRR at break-even: $50,000
- Time to break-even: Month 15-18
- Payback period: 18-24 months

**Scenario B: Moderate**
- Investment: $900,000
- MRR at break-even: $60,000
- Time to break-even: Month 18-21
- Payback period: 21-27 months

**Scenario C: Optimistic**
- Investment: $1,000,000
- MRR at break-even: $70,000
- Time to break-even: Month 21-24
- Payback period: 24-30 months

**Recommended Operating Model:**
- Monthly burn during dev: $50,000/month
- Monthly burn post-launch: $30,000/month (team + infrastructure)
- Runway needed: 18-24 months
- Funding required: $800K (development) + $360K (runway) = **$1.2M**

✅ **Financial**
- [ ] $1M+ funding secured or committed
- [ ] 24+ months of runway available
- [ ] Acceptable ROI timeline (2-3 years)
- [ ] Sustainable unit economics projected

✅ **Team**
- [ ] 3+ senior developers committed
- [ ] DevOps/infrastructure expertise available
- [ ] Product manager assigned
- [ ] QA/security resources secured

✅ **Market**
- [ ] Clear differentiation from competitors
- [ ] Validated product-market fit signals

- [ ] Timeline pressure (<6 months to launch)
- [ ] Cannot secure experienced team
- [ ] Regulatory uncertainty unresolved
- [ ] Competitive landscape too crowded
- [ ] No clear revenue model
- [ ] Technical complexity underestimated
- [ ] Zero risk tolerance (unrealistic for startup)

#### Decision Matrix

| Criteria | Weight | Score (1-10) | Weighted Score |
|----------|--------|--------------|----------------|
| **Financial Readiness** | 25% | ? | ? |
| **Team Capability** | 25% | ? | ? |
| **Market Opportunity** | 20% | ? | ? |
| **Technical Feasibility** | 15% | ? | ? |
| **Legal/Compliance** | 15% | ? | ? |
| **TOTAL** | 100% | ? | ? |

**Decision Thresholds:**
- 80-100: Strong GO (High confidence)
- 60-79: Conditional GO (Address gaps first)
- 40-59: HOLD (Significant concerns)
- 0-39: NO-GO (Too risky)

---

### Alternative Strategies

#### Strategy A: MVP Focus (Lower Investment)
**Cost:** $300K-400K
**Timeline:** 5-6 months
**Scope:** Only Phase 1 + Phase 2 (core features)
**Risk:** Limited monetization, may need pivot

#### Strategy B: Phased Funding (De-risk)
**Round 1:** $400K (Phase 1 + Phase 2)
**Milestone:** 500 paying users, $25K MRR
**Round 2:** $400K (Phase 3 + Phase 4)
**Risk:** Funding gap risk

#### Strategy C: Partnership/White Label (Reduce Build)
**Approach:** Partner with existing exchange or platform
**Cost:** $200K-300K (integration + customization)
**Timeline:** 3-4 months
**Risk:** Less control, shared revenue

#### Strategy D: Acqui-hire (Buy Talent)
**Approach:** Acquire small team with similar product
**Cost:** $500K-1M (acquisition) + $400K (development)
**Timeline:** 4-6 months (faster to market)
**Risk:** Integration challenges
