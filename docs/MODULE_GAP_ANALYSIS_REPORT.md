3. **Payment Processing**
   - Risk: Cannot collect revenue
   - Mitigation: Stripe integration in Phase 2

4. **Test Coverage**
   - Risk: Bugs in production = financial losses
   - Mitigation: Continuous testing throughout phases

5. **Real-time Data**
   - Risk: Stale data = bad trading decisions
   - Mitigation: WebSocket implementation in Phase 1

---

## Conclusion

### Summary
- **65% complete** overall, but critical features missing
- **10 P0 blockers** preventing core functionality
- **310 total gaps** across all modules
- **15 weeks** to reach MVP functionality
- **Test coverage** must increase from 15% to 80%

### Go/No-Go Decision Criteria

**GO if:**
- Phase 1 completed (real-time + execution)
- Test coverage > 60% on core modules
- Security audit passed
- Payment integration working

**NO-GO if:**
- Bot execution not implemented
- No 2FA
- Test coverage < 40%
- Tenant isolation not validated

### Next Steps

1. **Immediate (This Week):**
   - Implement WebSocket for market-data
   - Set up Redis for rate-limiting
   - Begin bot execution engine

2. **Short-term (This Month):**
   - Complete Phase 1 (Unblock Core Trading)
   - Add tests to critical modules
   - Security hardening

3. **Medium-term (Next Quarter):**
   - Complete Phases 2-3
   - Reach 80% test coverage
